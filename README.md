# Advent Of Code (2019)

The idea behind this repo is to run `scraper/scrape_languages.py` to generate list of programming languages, then use [random.org](https://random.org) to get the language you need to write your solution in.

So, at 04 Dec, 2019 there was 121 languages fetched into the `language.txt` list.

> *EDIT:* Rerolls are allowed, when the language in question is impossible to use under Linux or, worse case, Windows. Case also stands for the proprietary programming languages and languages that require paid license.

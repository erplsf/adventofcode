# Advent Of Code (2019)

The idea behind this repo is to run `scraper/scrape_languages.py` to generate list of programming languages, then use [random.org](https://random.org) to get the language you need to write your solution in.

So, at 04 Dec, 2019 there was 121 languages fetched.

Day 1: Lot #67 -> Rapira
